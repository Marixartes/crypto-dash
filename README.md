## Crypto Dash

Crypto Dash is a small **React-based cryptocurrency dashboard** built as part of my React learning journey.
The project focuses on working with APIs, routing, charts, and building a clean UI using modern React tools.

It displays live cryptocurrency market data, allows browsing popular coins, and shows basic price charts and details for individual coins.
